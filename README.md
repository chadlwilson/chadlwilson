### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm using ~~WhatsApp~~ GitHub!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently mainly working in my spare time as primary maintainer for [GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/) ([on Github](https://github.com/gocd/gocd)) and its suites of plugins, an open source self-hostable CI/CD server that promotes visualization of dependent pipelines
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about GoCD, continuous delivery, deployment/delivery automation tooling, the curiosities of build & release tooling across language ecosystems, software supply chain security, defense-in-depth, and all manner of things learned from a lifetime in software engineering, architecture and variations of technical leadership roles.
